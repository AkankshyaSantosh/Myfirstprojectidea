      <h1 class="flex-centered">Extra Features</h1>
      <ul class="flex-centered">
        <li>
          <b> Immersion</b> The users are placed in a virtual space, cut from
          the real world on a sensory level. VR headsets allow this by occupying
          their whole field of vision, while headphones achieve the same results
          with sounds, thus fully immersing the users in another world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interactivity</b> To feel real, a simulated environment should
          include virtual elements we can interact with: picking up an item,
          swinging a sword to kill a goblin, breaking a mug, pushing the
          ignition button of plane in a flight simulator, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Education</b> Vr education solutions to be used in school are still
          at an early stage. However, as students tends to have a better
          retention through seeing, hearing and doing, study material made in VR
          seem to be a great fit. Vr offers detailed visualization (anatomy,
          work of arts, planets, etc.). A concrete, already existing project is
          Google’s “Expedition”. It provides teachers with headsets virtually
          taking students outside of the classroom to explore in first person
          the following locations: the surface of mars, Antartica, the Macchu
          Pichu, the bottom of the sea, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Car design</b>It is possible for a car designer to draw full-scale
          sketches. Car designers get a clear idea of what the final product
          will look like at an early stage of the project. Thanks to Its
          flexible nature, designers can quickly make assessments, adjust and
          iterate. This technology along with other 3d and CAD software are
          likely to reduce the need for clay models.
